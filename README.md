# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-built-from-scratch
Built ML Algorithms from scratch in Python.

1. Fitting a line: (a)Learnt the basics of fitting a line through datapoints and evaluating on basis of bias/variance.
                   (b) New learnings: (i) np.polyfit = takes two arguements viz. feature X and y which were randomly generated
                                          and this returned an array of coefficients.
                                       (ii) np.poly1d = takes the array of coefficients passed in the polyfit method and returns
                                             a polynomial equation with the coefficients.
